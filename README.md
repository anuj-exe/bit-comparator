# bit-comparator
Comparing 4 bit numbers (positive and negative) without using comparison operators

a0, a1, a2, a3 are the digits of **a** number.
b0, b1, b2, b3 are the digits of **b** number.
s0 signifies sign of a, if s0 = 1, a is negative; if s0 = 0, a is positive
s1 signifies sign of b, if s1 = 1, b is negative; if s1 = 0, b is positive

HMMMMM that is it ig
Rest, you can read the code to get it. Haven't used any comparison operators.
I couldn't find any such solution on stackoverflow, so I thought I should upload my own.
